\section*{Abstract}

%The function of the abstract is to summarize, in one or two paragraphs, the %major aspects of the entire bachelor or master thesis. It is usually written %after writing most of the chapters.

%It should include the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Definition of the problem (the question(s) that you want to answer) %and its purpose (Introduction).
%	\item Methods used and experiments designed to solve it. Try to describe it %basically, without covering too many details.
%	\item Quantitative results or conclusions. Talk about the final results in a %general way and how they can solve the problem (how they answer the %question(s)). 
%\end{itemize}

%Even if the Title can be a reference of the work's meaning, the Abstract should %help the reader to understand in a quick view, the full meaning of the work. 
%The abstract length should be around 300 words.

%Abstracts are protected under copyright law just as any other form of written %speech is protected. However, publishers of scientific articles invariably make %abstracts publicly available, even when the article itself is protected by a %toll barrier. For example, articles in the biomedical literature are available %publicly from MEDLINE which is accessible through PubMed. It is a common %misconception that the abstracts in MEDLINE provide sufficient information for %medical practitioners, students, scholars and patients[citation needed]. The %abstract can convey the main results and conclusions of a scientific article %but the full text article must be consulted for details of the methodology, the %full experimental results, and a critical discussion of the interpretations and %conclusions. Consulting the abstract alone is inadequate for scholarship and %may lead to inappropriate medical decisions[2].

%An abstract\cite{Ikeda1997, levensthein65:_binar, Middleton2002, salton89} %allows one to sift through copious amounts of papers for ones in which the %researcher can have more confidence that they will be relevant to his research. %Once papers are chosen based on the abstract, they must be read carefully to be %evaluated for relevance. It is commonly surmised that one must not base %reference citations on the abstract alone, but the entire merits of a paper.

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are an emerging technology that enabling new possibilities for localization and tracking. The Radio Tomographic Imaging(RTI) is a localization technique that analyses the signal strength between nodes inside a WSN making it possible to localize and track a person without it carrying a device.

To do this a system that measures the signal strengths of each link inside a WSN is needed. The approaches suggested by the literature however assumes that all the nodes inside a WSN can hear each other, making it impossible to apply this to a WSN that covers large areas like a whole floor or a warehouse.
To make it possible to apply RTI to large environments a new approach that makes signal strength measuring for a WSN possible where not every node can hear all the other nodes is necessary. 

This thesis provides an approach for such a signal strength measurement system that is self calibrating and takes into account that not every node can hear each other, making it possible to deploy it in large areas. To measure the signal strength each node needs to send a message. The suggested approach creates a schedule that defines a predecessor and successor for every node inside the WSN. This makes it possible that the nodes send the messages in a synchronized way avoiding collisions of messages that distort the measurements.

The system is then tested in a WSN with 32 nodes that covers a whole floor of a building with a size of $531 m^2$. These tests show that the the suggested approach can take measurements quick enough to make localization with RTI possible.
